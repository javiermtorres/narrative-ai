# Narrative AI #

This is the repository for experimentation in the narrative-ai project. The aim
of the project is exploring technologies for better storytelling, like the one
pioneered by Versu.

To learn more about the project, you can reach the group on the
[Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/narrative-ai),
read [the logs on irc](http://irc.doppioslash.com:8000/logbot/narrative-ai/),
or [visit the wiki](https://narrative-ai.hackpad.com).

New ideas are welcome!
